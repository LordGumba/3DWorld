# Overview
Welcome to my read me! hope you like what you see!

My game so far is simply a character that can move around. 
There are movement options like jumping, double jumping, moving in every direction and being able to look around, but the rest is under development. 
This software was written to show a basis of constructing 3d games to suppport the further production by upper management(My brain).  

Here is a video of me explaining the games code, and demonstrating it.

# Development Environment
I programed this with Godot, in the Godot coding language. However some of the things like the models came from a tutorial, thus it was not all I used.

# Useful Websites
These,websites showed me how to make and code the game.

* [Godot Forum](https://forum.godotengine.org)
* [Godot Docs](docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/index.html)
  
# Future Work
As you can tell, the gameis incomplete. So, outside of story, gameplay, and the world overall, here are some things I plan to do to improve the game.

* Fix the camera
* Add more Movements
* Make damage or inventory
